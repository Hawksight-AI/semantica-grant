        "description": "AI Engineer dedicated to building production AI systems and semantic technologies. Recently left full-time position to focus entirely on Semantica, recognizing the critical gap in the open-source ecosystem for comprehensive semantic layer infrastructure.\n\nOver a year of solo development has resulted in 29 production-ready modules, comprehensive documentation, and 50+ Jupyter notebook tutorials. Committed to advancing open-source semantic intelligence and enabling developers globally to build context-aware AI systems with structured knowledge.",

Modern AI applications (RAG, agents, multi-agent systems) require structured semantic knowledge with relationships, ontologies, and context—but existing tools process data as isolated documents without understanding semantic connections.\n\nSemantica transforms unstructured data (PDFs, emails, web, databases) into production-ready knowledge graphs through a complete pipeline: universal data ingestion (50+ formats), semantic extraction (entities, relationships, events), automatic ontology generation via 6-stage LLM pipeline, knowledge graph construction with conflict resolution, and GraphRAG combining vector search with graph traversal for 30% accuracy gains.\n\nThe framework is MIT-licensed, production-ready with 29 modules covering ingestion, parsing, semantic extraction, graph construction, reasoning, quality assurance, and AI application integration.",
